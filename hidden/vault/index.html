<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Kai...This is my secret stash. Congratulation on finding this page. It contains the things that I try to hide from people. but most of it is boring things you should not care about.</p>
<p>I am taking this to be a journey into myself. There are somethings I always want to say but is too scared or hard to say it. This is where I will put it, if someone finds it, so be it.</p>
<p><b>Achievement</b>: This is where I record my accomplishments, things that are interesting and meaningful that I accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Diary</b>: This is where I record my deepest feelings and thoughts, things that are not written in la Epics would be here.</p>
<p><b>Philosophy</b>: This really shouldn't be here, but I was too shy to post it on the main website. This is my ever evolving philosophy about life.</p>
<p><b>Secrets</b>: This is perhaps the darkest part of this website, this is my most inner secrets. Things I want no one to know, yet desperately want to get it out. This is where they lie. </p>
