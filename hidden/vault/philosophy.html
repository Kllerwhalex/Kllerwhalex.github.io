<h1><a name="_Toc443492100">Day 1, Life, Time and Control</a> – A examination of how to live life.</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Reasoning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Life  has three periods: the past, the present and the future. We live in the present  and therefore only exert control over present. The past is certain, while the  future is doubtful. </li>
  <li>Our  control is limited, we cannot control the weather or the earth. We have limited  control over others, our body possession and status. But what we do have is  complete control over is actualization of our mind. Specifically our beliefs,  emotions, impulses, desires and aversion, from which all of our action stems.  We could reason/convince in and out the existence of beliefs, emotions,  impulses, desires and aversion. For example, mental illness. TV, Pornography  and games in one form or another is all simply the reasoning of the mind. It is  all in the mind. </li>
  <li>An  impulse, emotion, desires, aversion and belief not acted on, not materialized,  is merely a thought, it is nonexistence.</li>
  <li>The  exertion of this control we have on the mind is referred to as self-control, it  is the control of our beliefs, emotions, fear, impulses, desires and aversion.</li>
  <li>Life  is then only in the present, not in the future or the past. For all then, the  primary experience is the same, as we only experience the present.</li>
  <li>All  humans want a good life, as I assume all humans do.  I assume, from logical conclusion, that  everyone then wants the best life possible. As it what is the BEST in their  opinion.</li>
  <li>To  do so then, you must utilize the short present in the most efficient fashion  possible to achieve this BEST present. Simply, you want to receive the most you  can from that fleeting moment. The more, the better. (you exert control over  what you can to guide you to what you want)</li>
  <li>Then  to live the best present. Four major virtues(crystals of principles) follows:</li>
  <li>Self-Control  – When it is appropriate we must act w/ self-control. This is what allows us to  immerse us fully into what is the present, allowing us to concentrate it, to  extract the wonders of it. This is also what prevents (supress (ST),  understand, reason (LT)) other distraction, emotions, ideas, thoughts, and  impulses from disrupting our immersion. This is what allows us to use wisdom to  make choices, the best choices. The practice of self-control is simply to act  with self-control, this closely ties with wisdom.</li>
  <li>Wisdom  – We must choose our activities. Also a part of our logic, it assists us in  self-control through logic and knowledge. It is the part of you that thinks and  decides what the best is and why is it the best action. In my ideals, you can  also call such &ldquo;best&rdquo;, a meaningful or purposeful action. The practice of  wisdom is to always maintain self-control over oneself so that you are always practicing  wisdom, thinking and making the best choices and preventing yourself from  making poor ones.</li>
  <li>Courage  – We must face all circumstances with courage. Courage is not merely the  absence of fear. In fact, it only occurs in the presence of fear, doubt and all  other horrors. It is two parts, one is the self-control that despite the  overwhelming fear, controlling yourself to calmly and wisely understand,  evaluate and proceed through an action. Two, is the unwavering belief that you  can accomplish the first. This is what allows us to self-control ourselves to  utilize wisdom to make wise decision in difficult situations. This maintains  the constancy of Self Control and Wisdom to make the best present.</li>
  <li>Justice  – Part wisdom, part self-control. We must be just towards others. We must be  just towards ourselves. This is what prevents us from falling into difficult  situations in society. Two parts. Self-control to allow us to utilize wisdom  while not performing damaging actions. While wisdom for us to long term be free  of performing the damaging action. </li>
  <li>In  short, for the best</li>
  <li>Self-control  for ability for possibilities(rather than controlled by nature)</li>
  <li>Wisdom  for choosing the best(rather than controlled by nature)</li>
  <li>Courage  for maintaining self-control and wisdom in difficulty</li>
  <li>Justice  for preventing one from falling into difficulty</li>
  <li>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</li>
  <li>So  live in the present with self-control, wisdom, courage and justice, and you  will have the best. That is the best that even the gods can ask of you</li>
  <li>Ask  all of the following questions upon every decision. You must have yes for all  four.</li>
  <li>Am  I living with self-control? If not how can I?</li>
  <li>Am  I living with wisdom? If not how can I?</li>
  <li>Am  I living with courage? If not how can I?</li>
  <li>Am  I living with justice? If not how can I?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Main question: How do I control myself in the present?</h2>
<p>I  have noticed recently, that though I can study in the short term no  difficulties, in the long term I am distracted. Rather there seems to be not  only this resistance to the act of studying but also a sense of imaginary pain.  Why? Let&rsquo;s explore first.<br>
  Action  in the present. How do they come about? How is an action completed?</p>
<ul>
  <li>A  action is driven by a factor, some sort of reason, or that is what we make it  to be</li>
  <li>An  action can be driven by emotions (fear, greed, enthusiasm, and interest),  beliefs, desire, instinct and reason. Often a mix of these combine to become  the reason behind our actions.</li>
  <li>Without  a drive, we would be inactive. Eg. Mental Patients.</li>
  <li>Without  certain drives, certain action would not exist Eg. Patients lacking fear.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>What  is self-control then? In a broad sense, self-control would be the manipulation  of these drives to control one another. Eg. Reason to supress emotions.  Creating emotions to influence instinct. It is an interconnected web.</li>
  <li>Is  it like shifting the weights to causes changing colors in the web of thoughts?</li>
  <li>Reason  for sure we can control, Reason is the use of logic at this moment. It is really  similar to a machine, which takes in info and outputs two possible answer,  whether it is reasonable or not. <br>
    Reason then, cannot be a drive. As it is merely a machine in essence, a very  complex one I must say. Rather it is its result that affects how we act.<br>
    we seek to act reasonably. That if an action is reasonable then it can be  acted. In one way or another, we seem to perceive reasonable as similar to the  meaning of truth. We try not to act on unreasonable things. </li>
  <li>I  perceive this &ldquo;reasonability&rdquo; as merely a check of whether the action coincides  with our belief.</li>
  <li>And  one of the major problem about reason is that it is based on the fact that the  belief has to be correct for the reasonability to be correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lets  back up for a moment now. So reason is merely a machine, which outputs yes or  no. it is basis depends on the factuality of its input.</li>
  <li>So  revise before. We are driven by three factors. Belief, Emotions and Instinct.</li>
  <li><strong>Instinct </strong>is driven purely by our  body, our body is malleable to a degree, and we could train our body to  overcome instincts. As far as I know, you can overcome them. Eg. Boxer&rsquo;s  flinch. In the short term however, we cannot control this. However, you can <strong>supress it or destroy its source </strong>if the  action is not refractory length (milliseconds). Again, the source eventually  lies on a belief. If you can prove that the source is not reasonable  corresponding to your belief, or that belief is incorrect, the instinct will  die out. (eg. Snake in a cage, CN tower walk)<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>This is also a powerful  force to be reckoned with, though not on a momentary level. Habit is an  instinct drive, it happens on a millisecond to millisecond basis, fast and  furious. A strong habit can benefit one greatly indeed. But notice that it is  only malleable on a long term scale.</strong></li>
  <li>Revise:  our momentary action (Not millisecond, nearly all of our action) is based upon  belief and emotion.</li>
  <li>Emotions  is quite volatile, it is closely interrelated to both the body and our beliefs.  Our emotions can be manipulated both via our body and beliefs. Sickness puts us  down, Beliefs can put us into depression or ecstasy. Emotions again is faster  than belief, but its basis eventually lies on belief. We cannot be mad if our  belief don&rsquo;t match it. It is really on the short end of a moment. Rather it is like  a pseudo-reason that is used to check situations and our beliefs and quickly  give a rapid response. Though its difficulty is that it lacks the rigour of  reasoning, as a result it often leads to errors. It is a drive that happens at  the very short end of moment level, and is a very powerful driving force  (machine?) that can be used.</li>
  <li>Speed:  Instinct&gt;Emotion&gt;Belief</li>
  <li>Revision:  Emotion is again just another machine like reason, except it is a very rough  checker of belief and body to reflect its actions. So on a momentary level we  are driven purely by belief. With two machines working, reason and emotion  which reads the situation and your own belief to output its own action. A good  analogy would be relating the idea of a belief to pieces of code. Your sensations  are what we call input. Two program processes the sensation input, uses the  code and outputs a path for the machine to follow. The two programs have  different attributes. Emotion, is a very fast program, it processes very fast,  but it is prone to error, and it is also picks up on pieces of codes that the  other program &ldquo;reason&rdquo; would not pick up. Reason on the other hand, is much  slower, less prone to error and only picks up &ldquo;specific codes&rdquo; and processes  them. When we correct emotions, we are really saying that the emotional  machinery made an error, RETRY, and the emotional machinery will retry and give  another output. But there are times when emotion and reason don&rsquo;t match despite  RETRY. The then problem lies in the codes they take up.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>So  if you only use belief to drive your actions, while not fixing the other  beliefs driving your emotions. You could end up in a start and stop and start  situation. Intermittent. As when you start an action, you want to stop as your  emotion tell you NO. Your belief then comes in and suppress the emotion, you  get relief for a moment and you work. However, in another moment, the emotion  comes up again and rebels. The vicious cycle continue.  </li>
  <li>Though  I do believe in the power of a strong belief. This intermittent occurrence may  generate counter beliefs, like &ldquo;I CANT FOCUS&rdquo;. Which weakens your belief  somewhat further. If you fall into that vicious cycle, it may, if fallen far  enough, remove you from your current action.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>It  seems everything lies on &ldquo;belief&rdquo; on a momentary level. But what is belief?</li>
  <li>Review  first. </li>
  <li>Belief  is the basis for momentary level function</li>
  <li>Reason  and Emotions are two separate machines that uses belief as input and gives  actions as output.</li>
  <li>We  have control, on a momentary level.</li>
  <li>We  control the turn on of reason. We also regulate the integrity of reason.</li>
  <li>We  cannot turn off or on of emotions (out of our control). But we can suppress or  silence it (if it is unreasonable) through observation, quality check and  regulation (in our control). </li>
  <li>Remember  a thought not acted on is non-existent. So we do <strong><u>CONTROL</u></strong>the most basic aspect of emotions, its ability to  lead to actions</li>
  <li>The  basis for control then is <strong>Reason </strong>and <strong>Belief</strong>.</li>
  <li>OUT  OF OUR CONTROL </li>
  <li>On  a short term level: We cannot control the shutoff of emotions or reason. </li>
  <li>Momentary  level: We are limited in control of how emotions function, Eg. What emotions to  choose at this moment right now. On the long term, maybe. But not on a  momentary level.</li>
  <li>On  a reaction level: We cannot control instinct. We can manipulate its outcome in  the momentary level. We can change its programming in the long term, but on the  reaction level, we can&rsquo;t control it. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>So  belief. What is belief then?</li>
  <li>Belief  is something you perceive to be true based on its premise. It&rsquo;s premise it is  another belief after another. The structure is similar to the idea of a  pyramid, but with a bad architect, there are times when the reasoning between  its premise and argument is almost non-existent. Bad glue. </li>
  <li>Belief  could still be strong or weak, that is called faith. Ironically, it is the  possibility of it being true, this may or may not be related to the  truthfulness of its premise.  Rather it  is held by our other beliefs, whether it stands up to those ones.</li>
  <li>We  can create (if it is reasonable), suppress and silence (if unreasonable)  beliefs, it takes time. It ranges from the middle end of the moment to a long  term process if the belief is built in a large architecture or is to be met  with a great fight. </li>
  <li>Belief  is established by reason and reason only, emotions cannot bring about belief.  ONLY reason. Though the reasoning may be poor or the premise may be false…L.</li>
  <li>Our  momentary actions are based upon our belief. Changing our belief changes our  action and the continuity of our action.</li>
  <li>So  to change how we act on a momentary basis, we must first change our belief.</li>
  <li>Our  emotion and reason is based upon our belief, if there is any problem check back  to your belief.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Examination of Beliefs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE  GREATEST AND MOST DANGEROUS BELIEF: I CAN&rsquo;T DO IT.</p>
<p>My  test: <br>
  I  can&rsquo;t study because:<br>
  Its  boring<br>
  I  don&rsquo;t have ability to concentrate<br>
  I  am stupid<br>
  AGGH  THE EXAM is coming up im stressed<br>
  Whats  the point, you will never get in anyways<br>
  IT  IS TRUE THAT I CANT STUDY<br>
  I  cant study before how do you expect me to study now<br>
  I  will be distracted by porn games and the IIINNNTERNEEETTTT<br>
  I  learned this before I don&rsquo;t need to study, lets skip plllzzzz<br>
  I  cant figure out my mind so I cant help myself<br>
  Agghh  my emotions wont let me<br>
  I  cant calm down enough to study<br>
  I  will procrastinate, I know it.<br>
  MCAT  is hard, no matter how much I study, I won&rsquo;t be prepared for it, and I will  fail<br>
  I&rsquo;m not like other people<br>
  I  will fail at life anyways<br>
  I  have no friends<br>
  I  want to die…<br>
  There  are better ways of studying why don&rsquo;t you use them<br>
  I&rsquo;m  studying ineffectively, why you don&rsquo;t use this or that<br>
  Im  not remembering anything<br>
  Aggghhh  so much work, it&rsquo;s hard and going to take forever<br>
  I  can&rsquo;t finish this.there are other fun things<br>
  I  want to playyyy<br>
  Fuck  you fuck youuu</p>
<p>I  can study.<br>
  I  only have the present. It is just this moment. This short moment. The future is  yet to arrive and sim disconnected from that. &ldquo;fun&rdquo; things wont make me happy  in the present, they will make me confused and sad.  My belief can be changed. It is possible, it  is designed by human to be completed by human. I am studying not for the sake  of not being a failure, I don&rsquo;t care if I am one or not. I am studying in an  effort to prove my own beliefs, that I am able to study, I am able to change, I  am &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in some way. I can endure more difficult studying, after all it is  just a moment. For a moment, everything is endurable. I&rsquo;m not losing anything  by studying, &ldquo;fun&rdquo;… Here is when something pops up. I am not losing anything by  studying.<br>
  I  feel a sense of tension and incoherence in this. Something in my mind is  rejecting, but I don&rsquo;t know what that belief or idea is. Perhaps this is the  one the beliefs that was used by emotion. Similarly the sentence &ldquo;I want to  playyy, I want something fun and exciting, I want exhilaration&rdquo;<br>
  RETORT: I WANT POWER, I WANT FAME, I WANT TO ACHIEVE. Psh pleasure, that&rsquo;s for  kids. Thiis guy is a kid. Puny kid, now shut up and BE A MAN. MUHAHAHHAHAHAH +  I seekth knowledge, great one. I am playing by learning. Now bequeath you  ignorant one.<br>
  It  is not boring, you are making it so. I know you learned this before, but…<br>
  Again,  I feel a sense of tension and incoherence in this. Something in my mind is  rejecting</p>
<p>You  having friends or not is irrelevant to this, you future life failing has  nothing to do with this.<br>
  RETORT:  the optimistic guy: you are going to be awesome life. WOOOOT. Really man  chances are pretty much the same.<br>
  Again,  I feel a sense of tension and incoherence in this. Something in my mind is  rejecting</p>
<p>I  don&rsquo;t wanna change, I don&rsquo;t wanna be stuck studying 24/7, that would suck, that  is not the life III want.  I HATE IT I  HATE IT. GAHHHHH. I don&rsquo;t want to be a dork, I want to live, travel, enjoy and  experience LIFE HA!<br>
  RETORT:  I WANT POWER, I WANT FAME, I WANT TO ACHIEVE. Psh pleasure, that&rsquo;s for kids.  Thiis guy is a kid. Puny kid, now shut up and BE A MAN. MUHAHAHHAHAHAH<br>
  Again,  I feel a sense of tension and incoherence in this. Something in my mind is  rejecting</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc443492101">Day 2: Virtue of Character and  Maxims</a></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self-control –  &ldquo;When it is appropriate we must act with self-restraint.&rdquo;<br>
  Courage – &ldquo;We  must face all circumstances with courage.&rdquo;<br>
  Wisdom – &ldquo;We  must choose our activities and carry them out wisely.&rdquo;<br>
  Justice – &ldquo;We  must be just towards others, we must be just towards ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Live every moment with  self-control, courage, justice and wisdom. That is the best even the gods can  ask of you&rdquo;</li>
  <li> &ldquo;You have power over your  mind – not the world. Realize this, and you will find strength.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Life is divided into three periods—that which has been, that which  is, that which will be. Of these the past is certain, the present is short, and  the future is doubtful.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&quot;Two elements must therefore be rooted out once for all, - the fear  of future suffering, and the recollection of past suffering; since the latter  no longer concerns me, and the former concerns me not yet.&quot; &ldquo;As for the  present? We control that&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it&rsquo;s  endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it&rsquo;s unendurable . . . then  stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well. Just remember:  you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your  interest to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In our power are opinion, impulse, desire, aversion, and, in a  word, whatever is our own doing. Things not in our power include our body, our  possessions, our reputations, our status, and, in a word, whatever is not our  own doing.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;A good character outshines all possessions.&rdquo;</li>
  <li> &ldquo;To fear pain is to fear  something that&rsquo;s bound to happen&rdquo;</li>
  <li> &ldquo;We are all human&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything  better than justice, honesty, wisdom, self-control, courage—than a mind  satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and  satisfied to accept what&rsquo;s beyond its control—if you find anything better than  that, embrace it without reservations—it must be an extraordinary thing  indeed—and enjoy it to the full.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Thought is not action&rdquo;  A  thought does not have to be acted on, it is in our power to choose which  thought we act on. A thought unacted? well that is just thought. Nothingness.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Ocean, a drop of water. Compliments, cluttering of mouths. always  try to see thing for what they really are&rdquo; -&gt; See what really is the  signifigance of everything staring down from above, existing outside of time.  You see perhaps the limited significance in many of the action we perform.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Everything is a piece of work, even dying. There are dying in a  good way and there are the other way around. A work means we have a choice in  how we perform this task. A work also means there are important things and  unimportant things. A work also means that time is limited, you have only a  certain amount of time given to you, and it is up to you to choose what you do  in this period, there are the important stuff -&gt; &ldquo;the work&rdquo; and there are  other stuff &ldquo;distractions&rdquo;. All of these require the same currency time, and  you only have so much time.&quot; &ldquo;every moment you are working&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc443492102">Day 3. States of Mind?</a></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There  is also another state of mind. <br>
  The  secluded self<br>
  In  this state, you think you are stupid, invaluable, that somehow speaking out  would cause harm to you. <br>
  You  try to stay quiet and are hesitant to speak out, you doubt your ability to  think, and think others have a higher status/ability. You look for others  similar to you, so you can feel justified in this lack of courage. <br>
  This  is a very awkward state because a part of you want to speak out but you are  scared of the repercussion, you are scared of other&rsquo;s opinion, rather you value  other people&rsquo;s opinion too much. Is wrongness really such a big issue? No it  doesn&rsquo;t matter, it is merely the clucking of tongues and it is in the past.  Opinions are merely opinions. </p>
<p>The  written self<br>
  Initiated  by writing. <br>
  …etc  I am actually Unsure about this state</p>
<p>There  seems to be multiple states and these states could fit together to form a combo  state. A very intriguing idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc443492103">Day 4: Duty.</a></h1>
<p>Duty.<br>
  Life is inherently meaningless. A chaos of  particles. <br>
  I choose my role in this universe. <br>
  In choosing this role, I gain what is  called duty. <br>
  Duty is the role; the role is the duty. They  are two inseparable side of the same coin. <br>
  The duty is what makes the role meaningful,  while meaningfulness is why we choose the roles, why we perform the duty. <br>
  A teacher who does not teach is not a  teacher.<br>
  A student who does not learn is not a student.<br>
  A human who does not act as a human is not  one. <br>
  That is what we call duty. After all a role  is a set of action, a duty is exactly that set. <br>
  But what about rewards? </p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewards, they are not  important. Rewards will come to those who follow his duty, while abandons those  who don&rsquo;t. Thinking about rewards, aiming for the rewards, the external ones is  merely a distraction. That is not the duty of the role. </li>
  <li>Rewards, monetary and fame.  Those are the things we refer to as the external rewards. Those ones are  unimportant. You only need as much money as you need to live. Fame, well that  is merely the cluttering of tongues. No, you don&rsquo;t need any of that, nor you  should want a role because of them. </li>
  <li>Rewards are the product of the  duties. So if you want the rewards anyways, fulfill your duty. </li>
  <li>Duty. Roles only exist for the  things you find important, because those will be the only roles you choose.  These roles are the ones that define you, and funnily it is not the  materialistic aspect of the roles that define that role, but often the duty are  immaterial. Not money, not fame. But the duty. </li>
  <li>A student&rsquo;s role/duty is to  learn. That is not material. It is a belief, a character and a duty. </li>
  <li>Follow your duty, that will  lead you to happiness and success. </li>
</ul>
<p>Who are you? Who do you choose to be?</p>
<ul>
  <li>I choose to be a student. My  duty is to learn. </li>
  <li>I choose to be a medical  student. My duty is to show I&rsquo;m qualified to become a doctor</li>
  <li>I choose to be a son/grandson.  My duty is to take care of my family.</li>
  <li>I choose to be a brother. My duty  is to take care of my siblings. </li>
  <li>I choose to be have a good  life. My duty is to pursue a good life. One does that through action. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to have a  good life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fulfill your duty. That is  really all you need to do to have a good life, to be happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wisdom, Justice,  courage and self-control is mere just a part of that.<br>
  End</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a citizen of society. <br>
  You are committing an exchange with society  when ever you take on a role.<br>
  In exchange for &ldquo;money&rdquo; you partake in what  is known as &ldquo;duties&rdquo;. Tasks you accept as you take on this role. <br>
  Successful/diligence is what people  describe as people who accomplish these duties. </p>
<p>If you choose to be a medical student<br>
  Then you are accepting certain duties that  come with it for its rewards.<br>
  That is the meaning of a medical student:  its responsibilities. AKA its duties. </p>
<p>What does it mean to be a student. <br>
  It means you are a learner, you have a duty  to learn the material. Tests and Exams are tests if you learned the material.  Really it is the test of duty.  It is the  duty of the student to hand in assignments on time. </p>
<p>It is the duty of the father to care for  one&rsquo;s child. It is the same idea. You do get a reward, rather it is a perceived  reward. As no reward is a reward unless you perceive it to be. </p>
<p>In essence what makes up the role of a  mother, doctor, student and any other roles is its duty. Society and the world  rewards one for accomplishing one&rsquo;s duty in excellence and punishes those who  do not. Often this would mean stripping one&rsquo;s role. </p>
<p>It is a exchange with society. </p>
<p>If you choose a role. Eg. a premed student.  You must accept its duty also. You must accomplish its duties. What medical  school assess is simply one&rsquo;s ability to fulfill that duty. </p>
<p>What is a duty. </p>
<p>A duty is a responsibility. It is something  that must be done regardless of how you feel about it. Regardless of how much  you hate it. Regardless of what you are doing right now.  That is in essence &ldquo;duty&rdquo;. Failure to do so,  or choice of not doing so, strips you away from that role. </p>
<p>A student who never studies and goes to  class, do we call that a student? NO. In fact the school strips that student  away from school. </p>
<p>THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF ALL ROLES. DUTIES. </p>
<p>You choose the roles. Now you must accept  the duty of these roles. <br>
  You chose to be a Pre-med student. </p>
<p>So you have to accept the duty of </p>
<p>Obtaining a good GPA<br>
  Obtaining lab experience.<br>
  Obtaining   Volunteer experience.<br>
  Obtaining Reference letter<br>
  Obtaining a good MCAT score. </p>
<p>Achieving this is the meaning of your role. <br>
  The duty is the role. <br>
  So if you choose to be a medical student,  this is you duty. This is what you chose. </p>
<p>You chose to be a student.</p>
<p>So you have the duty of</p>
<p>Going to class.<br>
  Completing the assignments.<br>
  Be ready for tests.<br>
  Knowing the material.<br>
  Studying the material. </p>
<p>These are your duties. </p>
<p>You chose to be a son to Yarong Fu and  Guohua Wang</p>
<p>So you have the duty of </p>
<p>Loving your parents<br>
  Knowing your parent&rsquo;s birthday<br>
  Understanding your parent<br>
  Caring for them<br>
  Making them Happy. </p>
<p>These are your duties that you chose. </p>
<p>You accepted the role of the brother to  Zihuan and Zihao. The you have the role of </p>
<p>Loving your siblings<br>
  Playing with them<br>
  Teaching them<br>
  Caring for them when they are in need<br>
  Watching them grow.</p>
<p>These are your duties. </p>
<p>What is meaningfulness? <br>
  Meaningfulness is dthe duty you perceive  you intrinsically have. <br>
  That is why you feel doing the task of a  son or a brother is meaningful<br>
  That is why you feel helping others in  society is meaningful<br>
  That is why you feel pursuing your goal is  meaningful. <br>
  That is why one feels great when  accomplishing great deeds.</p>
<p>DUTY. DUTY. DUTY. DUTY. DUTY.</p>
<p>As an adult, You have a duty to take care  of oneself. You have a duty to care for those important to you. You have a duty  to improve and make the best of yourself. </p>
<p>It is not a matter of whether you chose/  want to do it or not. You already chose it when you chose this role. Once you  did that. You accepted its duties. Because the duties is the role. THE role is  the duty. You have already chose. </p>
<p>You have your duties. Duties are done  irregardless of what you want or don&rsquo;t want. That is duty. </p>
<p>What is the essence of a goal?</p>
<p>it is the duty. It is the things that you  do in the process.</p>
<p>then what is the  outcome, why even bother with the outcome,  why should I care about the outcome?????</p>
<p>Well. Let&rsquo;s look at a example.</p>
<p>Making a million dollar.</p>
<p>Well, is a million dollar worth anything?</p>
<p>No. it is not. It is just money. It is a  artifical creation we perceive to worth something. <br>
  What a million dollar is worth is what you do  with it. </p>
<p>Hmm. I am confused. So is the million  dollar worth something? What happen if I changed the million dollar to 10  dollars. </p>
<p>the pursuit of 10 dollars. Why does it seem  so different? </p>
<p>Because it seems easy. </p>
<p>But what if it is hard?</p>
<p>Say if you live in India, you are poor, and  you need to make 10 dollar to support your family. It is extrodinarily  difficult. </p>
<p>Wait...rather than the outcome. it is how  you use the outcome that matters. </p>
<p>Ten million dollar unused for a good  purpose is merely a stack of paper. </p>
<p>Money is intrincically a stack of paper. </p>
<p>the thing that matters is what you do with  it. </p>
<p>Sure, I can be lucky and suddenly become a  doctor by accident  having not learned  anything. But is there a point in such a thing? what defines a doctor is its  duties, not the salaries, not the reputation but in intrinsically in what they  do.  The reputation and salary is a  byproduct of their actions. </p>
<p>It is the pursuit of the million dollar  that justifies youself. It is the pain and tiring that you want and seek. </p>
<p>To want a goal is to want the process, to  love the failing, to love the pain. Because intrinsically these pain and  suffering have meaning, it is ironically the joy of that pursuit. without it,  all goals are empty. </p>
<p>Hacking a game and beating a game without  hacking is two different feeling. Yes you feel pain when dying, but perhaps  that is the idea. We are human.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>The reason why someone would hate and anger  at the failure to sell his product for a million dollar </p>
<p>his goal was not a million dollar, it is a  nice by product, rather his goal was to do something great. Rather he wanted a  justification of his wisdom in choosing this course,  that he putted his effort into something  great, he however seeks this justification of greatness through the  justification of society. </p>
<p>This is analogous to the idea of einstein  and the atomic bomb. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So if you choose to be a pre medical  student. You are choosing it because of its difficulty and tireness. You are  choosing it because of the dicipline required and the character it builds. You  are enjoying it because you enjoy pushing yourself, controlling yourself, and  leading youself towards something you feel purposeful. </p>
<p>Why does people feel bad when they don&rsquo;t  achieve that goal? because they know then in their heart that they did not push  themself hard enough. This is especially pertaining to goals that are humanly  possible. </p>
<p>When it is a matter of luck, when you tried  your best, or atleast what you perceive to be the best possible. You will know.  Then you wont feel bad no matter what is the result. </p>
<p>When it is not what you control, you will  not feel bad. </p>
<p>When you choose a goal. you are not  choosing the outcome. You are choosing it for its duty. </p>
<p>Wow. You are choosing it for its duty. Now.  DO YOU WANT TO CHOOSE THAT. </p>
<p>When you choose something, you should  choose it because you love its suffering. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you choose a goal, you choose its  duties along with it. <br>
  When you choose a goal, you are choosing a  way of living, along with its beliefs. <br>
  When you choose a goal, you are choosing it  because you find the act worthwhile of your time. <br>
  When you choose a goal, you choose it  because of either 1. a good life or 2. a meaningful life. </p>
<p>Meaningful, analagous to important and  having a purpose. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc443492104">Day 5: What is happiness.</a></h1>
<p>What is happiness? <br>
  I think happiness is composed of two parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The part of being not unhappy.  Not worried or being punished by yourself.</li>
  <li>The part of being focused and  enjoying the moment or gaining of meaning(fulfillment). </li>
</ul>
<p>Our worries and our roles are the only two  things that makes us unhappy. <br>
  Being focused without any other reason  makes us happy. <br>
  That is happiness.<br>
  Perhaps that is how distraction works. It  removes you temporarily from unhappiness and focuses you on an object of  interest. Not out of worries, fear or duty. But because of curiosity and  wonder. <br>
  Happiness occurs when unhappiness is  forgotten. But we have memories…we have roles and duty. This is perhaps one of  the greatest source of unhappiness, yet also happiness. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do something that will make you  unhappy in the future. Don&rsquo;t do something you will regret or hate. Its not  worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good life is however different. A good  life, is a life, when one is close to death that one finds to be &ldquo;good&rdquo;. </p>
<p>How to be happy?<br>
  Duty is the answer to happiness. <br>
  Doing your duty makes you happy. <br>
  Doing your duty helps you not to be  unhappy. </p>
<p>Games, TV, radio, novels give you ecstasy.<br>
  Not happiness. Happiness lasts, Ecstasy  does not. <br>
  Games, TV…etc. does not represent a role.  Therefore it has no duties. <br>
  No duties also means no role. No role, it  is then not you. You cant justify yourself this way. <br>
  If it is not you, how can you be happy. </p>
<p>Every action you do forms a identity. <br>
  You are a collection of identity. <br>
  What you are trying to do is to form a  identity.</p>
<p>The reason why you don&rsquo;t follow estesy  because it distracts you from your ability to choose.<br>
  Action. Action are identity. </p>
<p>Reality can give you all that you want. Not  the virtual world.</p>
<p>We are not in search of fun. We are in  search of happiness. The internet can&rsquo;t give you that. Only the real world can.  Only the real world can.</p>
<p>You want the identity of a medical student<br>
  Therefore you need the identity of a good  premed student<br>
  You want the identity of a good good premed  student<br>
  Then you need to try to do the duty of a  premed student.</p>
<p>I would be happier if I did my duties</p>
